# Signature Verification Accuracy Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current signature verification system is producing false negatives - identical images are scoring only 0.488 similarity instead of near 1.0. This critical accuracy issue needs to be resolved to ensure the system can properly identify genuine signature matches while maintaining discrimination against forgeries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Perfect Identity Detection

**User Story:** As a user uploading the exact same signature image twice, I want the system to recognize it as a perfect or near-perfect match, so that I can trust the system's accuracy for genuine signature verification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the same image file is uploaded twice THEN the system SHALL return a similarity score >= 0.95
2. WHEN identical signature content is uploaded in different file formats THEN the system SHALL return a similarity score >= 0.90
3. WHEN the same signature is uploaded with minor compression differences THEN the system SHALL return a similarity score >= 0.85

### Requirement 2: Robust Feature Extraction

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the signature verification algorithm to extract meaningful and consistent features from signature images, so that identical signatures produce consistent high similarity scores.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing signature images THEN the system SHALL normalize for common variations (brightness, contrast, minor scaling)
2. WHEN extracting features THEN the system SHALL prioritize shape and structural characteristics over pixel-level differences
3. WHEN comparing features THEN the system SHALL use robust distance metrics that handle minor preprocessing variations
4. WHEN an image has no signature content THEN the system SHALL handle empty/blank images gracefully without errors

### Requirement 3: Calibrated Similarity Scoring

**User Story:** As a user comparing signatures, I want the similarity scores to be meaningful and well-calibrated, so that I can set appropriate thresholds for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing identical signatures THEN the system SHALL produce scores in the 0.90-1.00 range
2. WHEN comparing signatures from the same person THEN the system SHALL produce scores in the 0.70-0.95 range
3. WHEN comparing signatures from different people THEN the system SHALL produce scores in the 0.20-0.60 range
4. WHEN comparing obvious forgeries THEN the system SHALL produce scores in the 0.10-0.40 range

### Requirement 4: Algorithm Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that each component of the signature verification pipeline works correctly, so that I can identify and fix the root cause of accuracy issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preprocessing images THEN the system SHALL maintain signature structure and key features
2. WHEN extracting features THEN the system SHALL produce consistent feature vectors for identical inputs
3. WHEN calculating distances THEN the system SHALL use appropriate metrics that reflect signature similarity
4. WHEN transforming distances to similarities THEN the system SHALL use calibrated functions that produce meaningful scores

### Requirement 5: Fallback and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle edge cases gracefully and provide meaningful feedback when issues occur, so that I understand the system's limitations and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN image processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide informative error messages
2. WHEN feature extraction produces empty results THEN the system SHALL return appropriate default similarity scores
3. WHEN comparing incompatible signatures THEN the system SHALL handle the comparison gracefully
4. WHEN system components fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to simpler but reliable methods
